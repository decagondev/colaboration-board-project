# Git Workflow: Main Branch Protection

## Critical Rule

**NEVER merge to `main` branch.** Only the user/project owner merges to main.

## Allowed Operations

- Create feature branches from `dev`
- Commit changes to feature branches
- Merge feature branches to `dev`
- Push to `dev` branch

## Forbidden Operations

- `git merge ... main` - DO NOT merge anything into main
- `git checkout main && git merge ...` - DO NOT do this
- `git push origin main` - DO NOT push to main

## Workflow

```
feature/xyz → dev → (user merges to main)
```

1. Work on feature branches
2. Merge completed features to `dev`
3. Push `dev` for deployments (Netlify deploys from `dev`)
4. **Stop there** - user handles main branch
